API
===

There are two sets of API available. There are basic stand-alone 
API for several languages. These are limited to sending SNMPv2c
notifications and informs. These can be found in the ``api/``
directory. 

In addition there is a `xixeventlib` Python package in the
``python/`` directory which supports SNMPv1, SNMPv2c and SNMPv3.
`xixeventlib` builds on PySNMP.
